# watchdog_node

This package provides a 'watchdog' node that monitors for specified conditions,
and takes a specified action if any condition becomes true. 

## Usage

`rosrun watchdog_node watchdog_node _config:=/path/to/config.yaml`

where `config.yaml` is the configuration specifying a list of watchdogs in 
terms of 'monitors' and 'actions':

```
- name: check_battery
  description: Monitors the battery level.
  restart_timeout: 30
  monitors:
      - monitor_type: TopicFieldCondition
        topic: /battery_state/lifePercent
        condition: "{value} < 97"
  actions:
      - action_type: SendEmail
        to_addresses:  [cburbridge@gmail.com]
        from_address: cburbridge@gmail.com
        message: "Warning: robot battery is critically low."
        server: mail-relay.cs.bham.ac.uk
        port: 25
- name: check_scitos_node
  description: Checks the /odom topic, kills scitos node if not published for 20s.
  restart_timeout: 30
  monitors:
      - monitor_type: TopicAlive
        topic: /odom
        max_duration: 20
  actions:
      - action_type: KillNode
        node_name: /scitos_mira
```

Each watchdog must have the following fields:

- `name`: any name chosen by the user
- `description`: some hopefully useful description string
- `restart_timeout`: how many seconds to wait after this watchdog has fired
before restarting the watchdog. If value is -1 then the watchdog will stop running after
it has been fired.
- `monitors`: a list of monitors that make up the watchdog. If any one of the 
monitors fires then the watchdog will fire and stop, restarting after `restart_timeout`.
- `actions`: a list of actions to take when this watchdog fires.

## Monitors

The following monitors are available:

```
- type:  TopicPublished
  description:  This monitor triggers the actions if a message is published on a given topic
  configuration fields:
    -  topic  :  The topic to listen to

- type:  TopicAlive
  description:  This monitor triggers the actions if there are no messages on the given topic for a given period
  configuration fields:
    -  topic  :  The topic to monitor
    -  max_duration  :  The maximum number of seconds to accept not receiving a message

- type:  TopicFieldCondition
  description:  This monitor checks a field in a given topic and triggers the actions when a condition is met.
  configuration fields:
    -  topic  :  The topic & field to watch, eg /topic/field
    -  condition  :  A python expression containing {value} as a place holder for the value of the topic field. For example '{value} < 30'

```



## Actions
The following actions are available:

```
- type:  KillNode
  description:  Sends a specified node a kill signal.
  configuration fields:
    -  node_name  :  The rosgraph name of the node to kill.

- type:  SendEmail
  description:  Sends an email using simple unsecure SMTP.
  configuration fields:
    -  to_addresses  :  A list of email addresses to send to.
    -  from_address  :  The email address to be sent from.
    -  message  :  The message body of the email.
    -  server  :  The SMTP server.
    -  port  :  The port the SMTP server uses.
```

## Developing new actions/monitors

### Monitors

Monitors are classes that derive from the base classes 
`watchdog_node.MonitorType`. They must provide `name`, `description` and `config_keys`
fields at the class level and implement a `start()` and `stop()` method. `start()` 
will be called when the monitor is started or restarted following the firing of 
the watchdog. `stop()` will be called when the watchdog fires or is shutdown.

In order to signal that the watchdog should fire, the class should call 'self.set_invalid()`.

TopicPublished provides a straightforward example.

Note that all modules defining monitors need to be imported in `monitors/__init__.py`


### Actions

Actions are classes that derive from the base class `watchdog_node.ActionType`. Similar to 
monitors they must provide `name`, `description` and `config_keys`
fields at the class level. They must also provide a `execute(self)` method that
will be called when the watchdog fires.

`KillNode` provides a straightforward example.

Note that all modules defining actions need to be imported in `actions/__init__.py`
