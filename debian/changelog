ros-indigo-door-pass (0.1.8-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #41 <https://github.com/strands-project/strands_apps/issues/41> from bfalacerda/indigo-devel
    door pass improvements
  * add door check script
  * update package.xml and CMakeLists
  * get topological map name for the logging
  * logging door checks to mongo
  * getting preemption to work
  * door pass tweaks
  * use only front langer ranges to calculate trans speed
  * 
    
      * disable/enable recoveries from mon nav when door is closed
      * used selected laser readings for the pass door calculations
      * stop using move base config
      * code clean
    
  * cleaner disable of mon nav recoveries
  * disable help from mon nav when door is closed
  * Added repeat publishing of stopping commands as they weren't behaving in sim. I think it might be the simulation though.
  * Limiting back x and rot value during door pass. This makes things a little slower and less repsonsive, but avoids big dangerous movements
  * code clean of door_passing.py
