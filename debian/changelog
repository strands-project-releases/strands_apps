ros-hydro-reconfigure-inflation (0.0.1-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Added license files
  * Wrong URL
  * [reconfigure_inflation] Preparing cmake and package file for release
  * renamed package to get rid of the scitos prefix.
    None of the other packages seems to use this so no refactoring needed.
  * Contributors: Christian Dondrup
